# vite-portfolio

The goal of this project is to recreate a Figma design as a React web app for my personal portfolio.
Here is the Figma link: https://www.figma.com/proto/jIjuTxuqZp8rGNX04YZHF2/Josh's-Portfolio?type=design&node-id=1-2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2

This is my first time using React, and the Vite framework. I have been using ChatGPT to learn how to create different components. 
It has provided a great starting point that I've built on.
